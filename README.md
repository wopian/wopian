### Hey There 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:

- [Apollo 11], digitising and proof reading the Assembly source code used to reach the moon in 1969
- [Kitsu.io], a content discovery and tracking platform for anime and manga fans (`Ember`, `JavaScript`)
- [kitsu], a framework agnostic [JSON:API] client implementation (`JavaScript`)
- [preferred-locale], get your users' most preferred locale from your app's translations (`JavaScript`)
- [Kitsu Season Trends], daily statistical trends of seasonal anime on [Kitsu.io] (`React`, `JavaScript`)
- and many more open source projects!

📷 I'm a hobbyist photographer over at [wopian.moe]

❤️ I'm looking for [sponsors] to keep my projects maintained and operational
